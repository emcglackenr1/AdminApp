# AdminApp
This is a wireframe for a responsive web application, created as part of an Open University project. 
Since it is only a wireframe there is no colour scheme or images added. This allows for easier evaluation of information organisation, page linking, user experience and the inclusion of the required features.
The project did not require JS so it was not included. However, I occasionally noted where a feature would have been better using JS. For example, in a responsive 'hamburger' style menu.
